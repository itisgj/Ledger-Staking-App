# Ledger-Staking-App

The ultimate objective of the project is to replicate the staking contract functionality of Ethereum 2.0. The requirements for this project are quite straightforward:

1. Enable individuals to stake Ether and keep a record of their staked amounts.
2. Once a specified time and staked amount threshold are met, prevent users from withdrawing their funds. Instead, these funds will be earmarked for a forthcoming initiative, such as Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation

Things to learn in this project:

1. Establish the scaffold-eth project framework.
2. Develop a Staking Contract.
3. Invoke an external Contract.
4. Generate unit tests for your Solidity Contract.
5. Utilize and verify your Contract through a React application on your personal computer.
6. Deploy the staking contract on the Ethereum Test Network!
